Pathfinding using the A* Algorithm

This was one of my first programming projects during my studies. This project uses the qt Framework.

Short Desciption:
The robot is set to a random position and has to find another random position inside the field matrix. 
A certain amount of fields can not be passed (also pseudo-randomly picked). The robot can only see the eight fields around him.
He knows where he has to end up and uses the A* Algorithm to decide where to go next.
Note that this is not the shortest distance, the robot decides from step to step where to head next.
