# RobotRescue
Simulation of guiding a roboter through a minefield one step at a time using the A* Algorithm

# Course
Intelligent Systems Design / 3. Semester

# Description
The robot is set to a random position and has to find another random position inside the field matrix. 
A certain amount of fields can not be passed (also pseudo-randomly picked). The robot can only see the eight fields around him.
He knows where he has to end up and uses the A* Algorithm to decide where to go next.
Note that this is not the shortest distance, the robot decides from step to step where to head next.

# API used
QT-Framework

# Execute
Some qt, gcc and perhaps java libraries are required.
